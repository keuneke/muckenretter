# muckenretter
muckenretter.de new container-based version
as php3 is deprecated at the current hoster, we need to update muckenretter.  
Rather than just upgrading to a new php-version, we want to take the opportunity to
  a) change architecture to something docker-container based
  b) migrate from current PaaS/SaaS setup to IaaS/PaaS
